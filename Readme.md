# improveflowH4-workflow
repository to demonstrate use of OneWorkflow 
## To run the example do the following:
1. Install Python 3.10 if neeeded
2. Set up a jupyter notebook environment, personally I like this https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks 
2. In _packages_ folder run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Manually modify relevant folder locations in the sections **Set up fixed user parameters**  **Set up custom user parameter** of the [notebook](SE28ExampleSimaWasimSestra/workflowCoreDemoSE28SestraAndWasim.ipynb) to point to your local location of input. See explanation in the different subsections of the notebook.
4. Please note that the required bin files will not be checked into git and will needed to be shared outside this repository.
